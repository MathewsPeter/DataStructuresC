# Binary Search Tree

Left subtree of a node has values lesser than the node.
Right subtree of a node has values greater than the node.
Left and right subtrees must also be a binary search trees. 
There are no duplicates.

Such ordered arrangement allows faster searching.

Example: How to sort a list of unique numbers: add them to a BST and do pre/post order traversal.

Searching uses a divide-and-conquer technique, where successive search space becomes half.
