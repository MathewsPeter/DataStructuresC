# Array

Properties:
Linear data strcuture.
Elements of same data type, stored at continuous memory addresses.		
Size decided at compilation stage.
Index starts at zero.
Used as the building blocks to build other data structures.
Used to implement sorting algorithms like bubble sort.
    
Advantages: Fast access, if memory requirement is known at coding-time, one can avoid memory wastage.

Disadvantages: Size must be fixed at coding-time. 

Memory and Runtime:
