# Stack
Insertion and Deletion happens at one end called Top of Stack.
LIFO (Last In First Out â€” the element placed at last can be accessed at first) structure.

Operations:
Push: Insert element on top.
Pop: Delete the topmost element(the element add last in time)
Peek: View the top element, without modifying it.

Stack can be implemented using Array (fast operation but fixed max size) or Linked List(max size is not fixed, can be slower)
